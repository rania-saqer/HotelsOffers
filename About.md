***This website developed by PHP programming Language.
PHP is one of the most commonly and widely used scripting language and there is a huge debate about the popularity of PHP.
There are some points that will guide you Why I Choosed PHP Programming Language For Development Website: 
PHP provides you more freedom  as it is open source and you can find any text editor easily .As well as it
easy to find and fix any error or fail , The main reason its Object Oriented Language which
the concept that gives you all advantages nowadays.From reducing the line of codes to the reuse of classes, 
all are the features that every developer wants to use while developing the application.

***I want this website to be the place where you can find best hotell offers .
My goal is show hotel offers in simple and easy ways So users can find what they want  quickly.

***My thought process during development this site , firstly i consumed the API service using  postman .

I looked to main things parameters send in the link as well as the result structure .
I bulid the initial thought and imagine how i will devlop it .

Next that i started  designing the index page and i maked formed called another php file to proccess the request

then i developed APICaller Class , this class is responsible to consume GET services . it have two attributes (URL ,params)

After that i started thinking how to show the response data and design the hotel offer card .
I tried to make it simple and in the same time show all the  offer data .

***I used proactive test strategy implementation of a project, which the test design process is initiated as early as possible in order to
find and fix the defects before the build is created.
 
 
***What i learned :
I learned  how to deploy the project to github and heroku from A-z  .


***I have three years experience in PHP , I got chance at my work(fetchr and Moict) to develop dashboards , internal system ,integrate with ERPsystems 
and buld APIs , use tech tools like geo IP and google maps .

As well as I am working on two  MVC frameworks (Yii2 and laravel ) .
In this site i liked to use Native PHP with MVC development  .
